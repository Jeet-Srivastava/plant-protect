### 1. Project Title  
**Smart Plant Disease Detection App Using Image Recognition**

---

### 2. Your Name & Roll Number  
**Jeet Srivastava**

---

### 3. Problem Statement  
"Farmers and gardeners often struggle to identify plant diseases early, leading to crop loss, reduced productivity, and increased pesticide use. Manual disease diagnosis requires expert knowledge, which is not always available, especially in rural areas. This project aims to provide a mobile-based solution to diagnose plant diseases from leaf images instantly and suggest possible remedies."

---

### 4. Proposed Solution / Idea  
"A React Native mobile application that allows users to upload or capture an image of a plant leaf. The image is then analyzed using an AI model or an external API (such as Plant.id) to detect the disease. The app will show the disease name, confidence level, and provide suggestions for treatment or prevention."

---

### 5. Key Features  
- Capture or upload plant leaf images  
- Disease detection using Plant.id API or custom ML model  
- Display of disease name, confidence score, and description  
- Recommended treatments or preventive actions  
- History of previously scanned plants  
- Clean, intuitive user interface

---

### 6. Target Users / Audience  
"Farmers, gardeners, agricultural students, plant nursery workers, and hobbyists."

---

### 7. Technology Stack  
- **Frontend**: React Native  
- **API Integration**: Plant.id API (REST API)  
- **Image Handling**: Expo Camera / React Native Image Picker  
- **Backend (Optional)**: Node.js / Express (for managing user data or API proxy)  
- **Database (Optional)**: Firebase / AsyncStorage / SQLite  
- **Design**: React Native Paper or NativeBase for UI components

---

### 8. Expected Outcome  
"A functional mobile app that enables users to identify plant diseases by simply taking a photo or uploading an image. The app provides fast and accurate diagnosis along with actionable treatment suggestions."

---

### 9. Timeline (Optional)  
- **Week 1–2**: Research plant diseases and finalize UI design  
- **Week 3–4**: Set up image capture and upload features  
- **Week 5–6**: Integrate Plant.id API and display results  
- **Week 7**: Add history, polish UI, test on multiple devices  
- **Week 8**: Final testing and deployment on Google Play Store

---

### 10. Additional Notes (Optional)  
- Using Plant.id API to avoid building and training a custom model in the initial version  
- Can expand to offline diagnosis using a TensorFlow Lite model in future versions  
- May include multi-language support based on user feedback
